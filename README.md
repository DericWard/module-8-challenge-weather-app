# module-8-challenge-weather-app
A JS weather app that display's the weather for your choice of city.
Displayed is today's weather for the next two hours, and a midday (12:00) five day weather forecast for the city you request.
A previously-searched-city button is added for each city you search for, avoiding the user having to re-type a city name. 
The previously-searched buttons persist on the user's device, when using the app, until the user chooses to delete them.
